Safari-Park project

We have safari-park with animals (10). Using key words we can sort or find specific animals.

1. Program.cs launches method Main()
2. Method main launches method HelloGuide() in Guide.cs
3. Method HelloGuide asks for a parameter (criteria) by which we want to find or sort animals.
4. Then by using imput the method calls a search method FindAnimal() from GuideSearch.cs
5.

Guide has two instruments: "Sort segment by", "Filter segment by"
